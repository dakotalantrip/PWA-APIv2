# PWA-APIv2

A .NET Aspire version of Dakota's PWA-API project (https://github.com/thedakotes/PWA-API). 

Prereqs:

- Visual Studio 2022
- Docker (https://www.docker.com)

This project needs to live (for now) at the same level of the PWA-Web folder, until we figure out if this even works.

Docker needs to be running on your desktop prior to running the project.
Set the startup project to be PWAApi.AppHost and click the 'https' button.
